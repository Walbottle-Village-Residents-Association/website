# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values

# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

# Site configuration for the WebP Generator Plugin
# The values here represent the defaults if nothing is set
webp:
  enabled: true
  
  # The quality of the webp conversion 0 to 100 (where 100 is least lossy)
  quality: 75

  # List of directories containing images to optimize, nested directories will only be checked if `nested` is true
  # By default the generator will search for a folder called `/img` under the site root and process all jpg, png and tiff image files found there.
  img_dir: ["/img"]

  # Whether to search in nested directories or not
  nested: false

  # add ".gif" to the format list to generate webp for animated gifs as well
  formats: [".jpeg", ".jpg", ".png", ".tiff"]

  # File extensions for animated gif files 
  gifs: [".gif"]

  # Set to true to always regenerate existing webp files
  regenerate: false

  # Local path to the WebP utilities to use (relative or absolute)
  # Omit or leave as nil to use the utilities shipped with the gem, override only to use your local install
  # Eg : "/usr/local/bin/cwebp"
  webp_path: nil

  # List of files or directories to exclude
  # e.g. custom or hand generated webp conversion files
  exclude: []

  # append '.webp' to filename after original extension rather than replacing it.
  # Default transforms `image.png` to `image.webp`, while changing to true transforms `image.png` to `image.png.webp`
