			  <h2>Gardening Group</h2>
			  <p><strong>Our gardening group is the inspiration for the Residents Association, they planted the seed that blossomed into the Tenants &amp; Residents Association.</strong></p>
			  <p>The Gardening Group are out most weekends planting new areas of the village. Now in its third year the Gardening Group continues to work hard around the village to make it a beautiful place to live.</p>
			  <h2>Can you Help?</h2>
			  <p><strong>We have so many ideas to make Walbottle beautiful but currently, only a few people are involved in doing it. We’ve found it is difficult to arrange group gardening sessions, as we can never find a good time for everyone.</strong></p>
			  <p>We’ve been successful in raising funds from our Ward Councillor, have won the Dobbies Local Community Gardening Competition and have just been awarded the ‘TBC’ RHS It’s your Neighbourhood.  Now what we need to do is spend the money and get the areas looking beautiful.</p>
			<p>Please see below a list of community gardening tasks that we need your support with. There are a range of tasks available that we hope more people could get involved with. These range from light deadheading and watering to weeding and digging over areas ready for planting.</p>
			<p>Please don’t feel you are stepping on anyone’s toes, if an area is untidy it needs your help. We do have a community WhatsApp group to discuss ideas and progress, if you would like to be added please complete the <a href="#getintouch" title="jump to the get in touch form">Get in Touch</a> form or email us at <a href="mailto:walbottlera@gmail.com" title="email Walbottle Village Tenants &amp; Residents Association">walbottlera@gmail.com</a>.</p>
			  <h2>To Do List</h2>
				<h3>Easy Jobs</h3>
				<p>Deadheading all planted areas.</p>
				<p>Watering – we’d really appreciate your help with water the flowerbeds and planters.  We now have a water source available at the village institute, please join the WhatsApp Group for details.</p>
				<h3>Medium Effort</h3>
				<p>Weeding all flowerbeds and planters.</p>
				<h3>Hard Work</h3>
				<p>Digging and clearing areas to prepare for new.  If we can get them prepared we have the money to plant them up.</p>
				<h3>Disposing of community gardening waste</h3>
				<p>Our councillor Linda Wright is happy to arrange for the disposal of our community gardening waste.  All we need to do is ensure it is bagged up in black bags and email her the location linda.wright@newcastle.gov.uk
where the flower beds are and red hearts showing the barrel planters. These areas need loving attention from time to time to keep them looking at their best.</p>
				<h3>Where are the areas?</h3>
				<p>Please see below a map of Walbottle. On it you will see Yellow Stars which indicates where the flower beds are and red hearts showing the barrel planters. These areas need loving attention from time to time to keep them looking at their best.</p>

			  <h4>RHS Award</h4>
			  <p><strong>Walbottle Village has been presented with a level 4 Thriving award by the Royal Horticultural Society and Northumbria in Bloom.</strong></p>
			  <p>This is a wonderful recognition of all of the hard work that our very small group of volunteers has put in to start making the village look beautiful again.  We have a long way to go to reach the stunning displays exhibited in the 1990’s when Walbottle won the National village in bloom award, but with some more volunteers and a continuation of what has been started who knows what is possible.</p>
