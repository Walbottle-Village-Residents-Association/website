			  <p><strong>The Walbottle Village Tenants and Residents Association was founded in 2020 during Covid lockdown to bring relief to residents of Walbottle Village by encouraging a community spirit and assisting the most vulnerable members of the community.</strong></p>
			  <p>The remit is expanding post lockdown to include a gardening club, a history group a food bank collection and organising social events which are open to all. We pride ourselves in being fully inclusive, having minority groups on the committee.</p>
